This is a simple menu system script that I wrote in python.
I don't use it anymore, but for I still get the occasional email about it.
It was originally hosted at: https://code.google.com/p/simple-menu-system/
I've decided to dump it in a git repository in case anyone is interested.

For bugs, questions, patches, and thanks, email: simple-menu-system@shubin.ca
